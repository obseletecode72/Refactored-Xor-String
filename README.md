# Refactored-Xor-String

i made this because every xor that i saw didnt "hide" the string from the memory, and bcz i was bored asf

crypts string at compilation time and it decrypts at execution time, and it free`s the buffer from the memory, so even you dumping the memory the string cant be "visible"

kernel not supported since we cant go around with the memory like this, for kernel use skCrypt or something like that, it will work
